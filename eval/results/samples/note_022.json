    "The patient is scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass. The patient has been earlier seen by Dr. X, her physician. She has been referred to us from Family Practice. In short, she is a 33-year-old lady with a BMI of 43, otherwise healthy with unsuccessful nonsurgical methods of weight loss. She was on laparoscopic gastric bypass for weight loss. She meets the National Institute of Health Criteria. She is very well educated and motivated and has no major medical contraindications for the procedure. The patient will undergo very low-calorie diet through Medifast to decrease the size of the liver to make laparoscopic approach more successful and also to optimize her cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities. She will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary effort for short and long-term success for weight loss surgery. I will see her two weeks before the plan of surgery for further discussion and any other questions at that point of time."
