        "With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.,Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate.  The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.  The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished.  One mL of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free.",
