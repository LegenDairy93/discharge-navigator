It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain. He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5. Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease. He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test."
